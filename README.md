## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Complete Chess Implementation**
- **All piece movements**: Pawns, Knights, Bishops, Rooks, Queens, Kings with proper rules
- **Special moves**: En passant, castling (kingside and queenside), pawn promotion (to any piece)
- **Move validation**: Comprehensive rule enforcement including check/checkmate detection
- **Drag-and-drop interface**: Intuitive click-and-drag piece movement
- **Turn-based gameplay**: Proper alternating turns between White and Black

### ðŸ¤– **Intelligent AI Engine**
- **Smart opponent**: AI that plays strategically using minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- **Position evaluation**: Advanced scoring with material, positional, and king safety factors
- **Opening knowledge**: Database of good opening moves for stronger early game play
- **Difficulty scaling**: Configurable search depth for different skill levels
- **Draw awareness**: Threefold repetition detection and stalemate recognition

### ðŸŽ® **Modern Web Interface**
- **Beautiful visual board**: Clean, responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- **Real-time updates**: Live game state with immediate feedback
- **Move history**: Complete game record with standard algebraic notation
- **Interactive controls**: Engine moves, auto-play mode, board flipping, game reset
- **Status indicators**: Clear notifications for check, checkmate, draws, and game state

### âš¡ **Advanced Features**
- **Threefold repetition**: Automatic draw detection when positions repeat
- **Position tracking**: Real-time monitoring of position frequency
- **Strategic repetition**: Engine avoids repetition when winning, allows it when losing
- **Board orientation**: Flip board to play from either perspective
- **Game management**: Save/restore game state, move validation, error handling

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zully/chess-engine.git
cd chess-engine
```

### Start the Game
```bash
# Option 1: Use the quick start script
chmod +x start-web.sh
./start-web.sh

# Option 2: Run directly
go run cmd/main.go
```

### Play Chess
1. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Play moves** by clicking and dragging pieces or typing in algebraic notation
3. **Challenge the AI** by clicking "Engine Move" 
4. **Enable auto-play** to watch the computer play both sides
5. **Flip the board** to play from Black's perspective

### Game Controls
- **Manual Move**: Type moves like `e4`, `Nf3`, `O-O`, `exd5`, `a1=Q`
- **Drag & Drop**: Click and drag pieces to move them
- **Engine Move**: Let the AI make a move for the current player
- **Auto Play**: Computer plays both sides automatically
- **Flip Board**: Change perspective between White and Black
- **Reset Game**: Start a new game

## Example Game Features

### Smart Move Input
```
Manual moves: e4, d6, Nf3, Nf6, Bc4, Bg4
Engine suggestions with evaluation scores
Drag-and-drop piece movement
```

### Intelligent AI
- **Opening play**: Develops pieces logically in the opening
- **Tactical awareness**: Finds checks, captures, and threats
- **Strategic depth**: Long-term planning with configurable search depth
- **Endgame knowledge**: Improved king activity in simplified positions

### Advanced Rule Support
- **En passant captures**: Automatic detection and execution
- **Castling**: Both kingside (O-O) and queenside (O-O-O) supported
- **Pawn promotion**: Promote to Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight
- **Draw detection**: Threefold repetition and stalemate recognition
